\subsection*{Exercise 6.1}
To see the problems of rejection sampling, consider the following variation of the previous example:

\begin{lstlisting}
    (define baserate 0.1)
    (define (take-sample)
      (rejection-sampler
       (define A (if (flip baserate) 1 0))
       (define B (if (flip baserate) 1 0))
       (define C (if (flip baserate) 1 0))
       (define D (+ A B C))
       (observe/fail (>= D 2))
       A))
\end{lstlisting}

Try to see what happens when you lower the basesate. What happens if we set it to 0.01? And to 0.001?
