\section*{Exercise 4}

\subsection*{Exercise 4.1}
What are \texttt{(bernoulli-dist p)}, \texttt{(normal-dist $\mu$ $\sigma$)} exactly? Are they real numbers 
(produced in a random way)?
We have seen that flip is a procudere with a probabilistic behaviour. 
Is, e.g., \texttt{(normal-dist $\mu$ $\sigma$)} something similar?
Try to evaluate \texttt{(normal-dist 0 1)}

\paragraph{Solution}


\subsection*{Exercise 4.2}
Evaluate
\begin{lstlisting}
    (dist? (normal-dist 0 1))
    
    (dist? (bernoulli-dist 0.5))

    (dist? flip)
\end{lstlisting}
What is the difference between flip and (bernoulli-dist 0.5)?
