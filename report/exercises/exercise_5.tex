\paragraph{Solution}
The developed program is written in Church and it is memorized in the file \textit{exercise\_5.rkt}. This file is a Racket file, but 
the code is written in Church, so to be executed it is necessary to use a Church interpreter.

The answers to the questions are shown below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[A.] The posterior probability $P(h\;|\;\text{win})$ is the conditional probability that the machine randomly gives to Bob
        a specific letter knowing that Bob has won. In particular, the fact that Bob has won is called \textit{evidence} and it is all
        we kwnow. The posterior probability can be computed with the Bayes' theorem by knowing: \textit{(i)} the conditional 
        probability $P(win\;|\;\text{h})$ (or \textit{likelihood}); \textit{(ii)} The prior probability $P(h)$ and 
        \textit{(iii)} the marginal probability $P(win)$.
        In particular it is proven that:
        \[ P(h\;|\;\text{win}) = \frac{P(win\;|\;\text{h}) \cdot P(h)}{P(win)}\]
    
    \item[B.] The probability $P(h\;|\;\text{win})$ has been manually computed for each hypothesis with Excel. First of all, the
        \textit{likelihood} has been computed by using the following formula: $P(win\;|\;\text{h}) = 1/Q(h)^{2}$ where $Q(h)$ is
        the position of the letter in the alphabet. Then the numerator of the formula of the Bayes' theorem is computed.
        To compute the marginal probability $P(win)$ the following formula has be used:
        \[ P(win) = \sum_{h} P(win\;|\;\text{h}) \cdot P(h)\]
        Then the posterior probability has been computed for each hypothesis by using the Bayes' theorem and the results are shown
        in Table~\ref{tab:casino-game}.

    \item[C.] The procedure \texttt{my-list-index} takes in input 3 parameters: \textit{(i)} \texttt{needle} that is an object, 
        which can be a number, a list, a quoted symbol or something else; \textit{(ii)} \texttt{haystack} that is a list containing zero 
        or more elements; \textit{(iii)} \texttt{counter} that is a number. 
        The procedure then returns \texttt{'error} if the first argument is not present in the second argument, otherwise it returns the
        third argument (i.e. the number) incremented by the position of the first argument in the list; the position is considered to be
        zero-based, so the first element of the list has index $0$, thus if the \texttt{needle} is in the first position of the list 
        \texttt{haystack}, then the third argument is not incremented. If the \texttt{counter} has value $0$ when the procedure is 
        called, then the procedure returns the position zero-based of the \texttt{needle} (if present), instead, if the value of the
        \texttt{counter} is $1$, then the procedure returns the position one-based of the \texttt{needle} in the \texttt{haystack}.
    
    \item[D.] The procedure \texttt{multinomial} takes in input two lists: the first one is a list of possible outcomes, instead the 
        second one is the list of the weights associated to the outcomes in the first list. In particular, the higher is the weight
        of one element with respect to the weights of the other elements, the higher is the probability to get that particular
        element. Indeed, the probability to get the element a specific element is given by the following formula:
        \[ P(e_{i}) = \frac{weight(e_{i})}{\sum_{j} weight(e_{j})} \]
        where $e_{i}$ and $e_{j}$ are the elements of the first list and the function \textit{weight} returns the weight associated
        to the argument (i.e. the element of the second list which is in the same position of the element in the first list).

        To implement the distribution of Table~\ref{tab:casino-game} with the procedure \texttt{multinomial}, two lists have been
        defined: \textit{(i)} \texttt{x} which contains all the possible outcomes and \textit{(ii)} \texttt{x-weights} which contains
        the weight of the elements of the first list. An alternative definition of the list \texttt{x-weights} is provided in order to
        prove that the formula previously defined holds.
        Then a simple model is defined: it simply returns a value of the first list according to the probabilities defined by the
        second list.
        \begin{lstlisting}[caption={Program which implements with \texttt{multinomial} the distribution of Table~\ref{tab:casino-game}},

; definition of the probability for each outcome
(define x-weights '(0.5 0.05 0.4 0.05))

; equivalent definition of the x-weights
; (define x-weights '(5 0.5 4 0.5))

; definition of a model which represents 
; the distribution given in the exercise
(define (model)
  (multinomial x x-weights))

; visualization of the results
(hist (repeat 10000 model))
        \end{lstlisting}
        Finally some samples are generated in order to show that the implemented distribution is equivalent to the distribution defined
        in Table~\ref{tab:casino-game}. The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:casino-game-d}.
