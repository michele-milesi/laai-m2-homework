\section*{Exercise 3}

\subsection*{Exercise 2}
Explain why (in terms of the evaluation process) these two programs give different answers 
(i.e. have different distributions on return values):
\begin{lstlisting}
    (define foo (flip))
    (list foo foo foo)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
    (define (foo) (flip))
    (list (foo) (foo) (foo))
\end{lstlisting}    

\paragraph{Solution}


\subsection*{Exercise 5}
Here is a modified version of the tug of war game. Instead of drawing strength from the continuous Gaussian 
distribution, strength is either 5 or 10 with equal probability. Also the probability of laziness is changed from 1/4 to 1/3. 
Here are four expressions you could evaluate using this modified model:

\begin{lstlisting}
    (define strength (mem (lambda (person) (if (flip) 5 10))))

    (define lazy (lambda (person) (flip (/ 1 3))))

    (define (total-pulling team)
      (sum 
       (map (lambda (person) 
                (if (lazy person) 
                    (/ (strength person) 2) 
                    (strength person)))
            team)))

    (define (winner team1 team2) 
        (if (< (total-pulling team1) (total-pulling team2)) 
            team2 
            team1))

    (winner '(alice) '(bob))                        ;; expression 1

    (equal? '(alice) (winner '(alice) '(bob)))      ;; expression 2

    (and (equal? '(alice) (winner '(alice) '(bob))) ;; expression 3
         (equal? '(alice) (winner '(alice) '(fred))))

    (and (equal? '(alice) (winner '(alice) '(bob))) ;; expression 4
         (equal? '(jane) (winner '(jane) '(fred))))
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[a.] Write down the sequence of expression evaluations and random choices that will be made in evaluating each expression.
    \item[b.] Directly compute the probability for each possible return value from each expression.
    \item[c.] Why are the probabilities different for the last two? Explain both in terms of the probability calculations 
        you did and in terms of the “causal” process of evaluating and making random choices.
\end{itemize}
