; EXERCISE. To see the problems of rejection sampling, consider the following
; variation of the previous example:

(define baserate 0.001)
(define take-sample
  (rejection-sampler
   (define A (if (flip baserate) 1 0))
   (define B (if (flip baserate) 1 0))
   (define C (if (flip baserate) 1 0))
   (define D (+ A B C))
   (observe/fail (>= D 2))
   A))

(hist (repeat take-sample 100))

; Try to see what happens when you lower the basesate.
; What happens if we set it to 0.01?
; And to 0.001?
